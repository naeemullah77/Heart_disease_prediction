# Heart Disease Prediction

This project involves developing a predictive model for heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict whether an individual is at risk of heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic features.

## Project Overview

The heart disease prediction model is built using Python and leverages libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of heart disease based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert dataset source, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, etc.]. It contains the following features:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (4 values)
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia (1, 2, 3)
- Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
